**FAKE NEWS DETECTION USING PYTHON**
Fake news has become a significant problem today, with the rise of social media and online 
platforms. The spread of false information can have profound consequences, including shaping 
public opinion, influencing elections, and even inciting violence. 
Detecting and combating fake news is crucial, and various techniques have been developed to 
identify and verify the authenticity of news articles. Some common approaches involve fact
checking by trained journalists or utilizing automated fact-checking tools. 
Machine learning algorithms have also been developed to automatically detect fake news articles. 
These algorithms typically involve analyzing the content of the article and identifying patterns that 
are characteristic of fake news, such as sensationalist headlines, biased language, or unsupported 
claims. 
To achieve this, machine learning models are trained on a labeled dataset of examples that 
distinguish between real and fake news articles. These models are then used to classify new articles 
as either real or fake on unlabeled data.
